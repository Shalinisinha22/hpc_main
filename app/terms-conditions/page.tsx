              <h2 className="border-l-4 border-[#bf840d] pl-4 mb-6 text-2xl font-bold py-2 rounded mt-10">GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR HOTEL ACCOMMODATION CONTRACTS:</h2>
              <ol className="gap-4 border-l-2 border-amber-200 pl-6  py-4 rounded-lg">
                <li><span className="font-semibold text-[#bf840d]">Scope of Applicability</span><br />1.1 These terms and conditions govern contracts for the rental use of hotel rooms for lodging purposes, as well as all other goods and services rendered by the hotel to the customer in this context (Hotel Accommodation Contract). The term "Hotel Accommodation Contract" comprises and replaces the following terms: accommodation, lodging, hotel, hotel room contract. 1.2 The hotel's prior consent in written form is required if rooms provided are to be sublet or rented to a third party, or used for other than lodging purposes. 1.3 The customer's general terms and conditions shall apply only if these are previously expressly agreed.</li>
                <li><span className="font-semibold text-[#bf840d]">The conclusion of Contract, Parties, Statute of Limitations</span><br />2.1 The hotel and the customer are the contracting parties. The contract shall come into force upon the hotel's acceptance of the customer's offer. At its discretion, the hotel may confirm the room reservation in written form. 2.2 Any claims against the hotel shall generally be time-barred one year after the commencement of the general statute of limitations period. Damage claims shall be time-barred after five years, independent of knowledge thereof, insofar as they are not based on claims arising out of harm inflicted on life, limb, physical health or liberty. These damage claims shall be time-barred after ten years, independent of knowledge thereof. The reduction of the statute of limitation periods shall not apply to claims which are based on an intentional or grossly negligent breach of obligation by the hotel.</li>
                <li><span className="font-semibold text-[#bf840d]">Services, Prices, Payment, Set-Off</span><br />3.1 The hotel is obligated to keep the rooms reserved by the customer available and to render the agreed services. 3.2 The customer is obligated to pay the agreed or applicable hotel prices for rooms provided and for other services accepted. This also applies to services ordered by the customer directly or via the hotel, which a third party provides and the hotel disburses. 3.3 The agreed prices include all taxes and local taxes in effect at the time of the conclusion of the contract. This does not include locally levied taxes, which are owned by the guest himself according to the particular municipal law, such as visitor's tax. If the statutory value-added tax is changed or if local taxes concerning the rooms and services are newly introduced, changed or abolished after these have been contractually agreed upon, the prices will be adjusted. This only applies to contracts concluded with consumers, if four months have passed between the conclusion and fulfilment of the contract. 3.4 The hotel can make its consent to the customer's later request for a reduction of the number of reserved rooms, services of the hotel or the customer's length of stay dependent on the increase of the price for the rooms and/or for the other services. 3.5 Hotel invoices not stating a due date are payable without deduction and due within ten days of receipt of the invoice. The hotel can demand immediate payment of the due debt from the customer. With the default of payment, the hotel shall be entitled to demand the respectively applicable statutory default interest in the amount of currently 8 percentage points or, with legal transactions with a consumer, in the amount of 5 percentage points above the base interest rate. The hotel reserves the right to prove greater damage. 3.6 The hotel is entitled to require a reasonable advance payment or a security, such as a credit card guarantee, from the customer upon conclusion of the contract. The amount of the advance payment and payment dates may be agreed in written form in the contract. The statutory provisions shall remain unaffected with advance payments or a security for package tours. 3.7 In justified cases, e.g. the customer's default in payment or expansion of the scope of the contract, the hotel shall be entitled, also after the conclusion of the contract up to the commencement of the stay, to demand an advance payment or security within the meaning of the above-mentioned No. 3.6 or an increase of the advance payment or security agreed in the contract up to the total agreed remuneration. 3.8 Furthermore, the hotel shall be entitled, at the commencement and during the customer's stay, to demand a reasonable advance payment or security deposit within the meaning of the above-mentioned No. 3.6 for existing and future accounts receivable from the contract, insofar as such has not already been paid pursuant to the above-mentioned No. 3.6 and/or No. 3.7. 3.9 The customer may only set-off, reduce or clear a claim by the hotel with a claim which is undisputed or decided with final, judicial effect. 3.10 For room booking under various schemes like Senior Citizen, Doctor, Army Officer etc. proof will be required at the time of check-in.</li>
                <li><span className="font-semibold text-[#bf840d]">Withdrawal of the Customer (Cancellation, Annulment)/ Failure to Use Hotel Services (No Show)</span><br />4.1 The customer can only withdraw from the contract concluded with the hotel, if a right of withdrawal was explicitly agreed upon in the contract, another statutory right of withdrawal exists or if the hotel gives its explicit consent to the withdrawal. The contractual agreement of a right of withdrawal as well as the consent to withdrawal from the contract shall be in written form. 4.2 Insofar as the hotel and customer have agreed upon a date for a cost-free withdrawal from the contract, the customer may withdraw from the contract up to that date without incurring payment or damage compensation claims by the hotel. The customer's right of withdrawal shall expire if he does not exercise his right of withdrawal vis-a-vis the hotel by the agreed date. 4.3 The hotel is entitled to the contractually agreed rate even if the rooms are not used, if a contractual right of withdrawal was not agreed or has expired, a statutory right of withdrawal or cancellation is not given and the hotel does not give its consent to the cancellation of the contract. The hotel must credit the income from renting the rooms to other parties as well as for saved expenses. If the rooms are not rented otherwise, the hotel can demand the contractually agreed rate and assess a lump sum for the saved expenses of the hotel.</li>
                <li><span className="font-semibold text-[#bf840d]">Withdrawal of the Hotel</span><br />5.1 Insofar as it was agreed that the customer can withdraw from the contract at no cost within a certain period of time, the hotel is entitled to its part to withdraw from the contract during this period of time if inquiries from other customers regarding the contractually reserved rooms exist and the customer, upon inquiry thereof by the hotel with a reasonable deadline set, does not waive his right of withdrawal. 5.2 If an agreed advance payment or an advance payment or a security demanded pursuant to No. 3.6 and/or No. 3.7 is not made even after a reasonable grace period set by the hotel has expired, then the hotel is likewise entitled to withdraw from the contract. 5.3 Moreover, the hotel is entitled to effect extraordinary withdrawal from the contract for a materially justifiable cause, in particular, if force majeure or other circumstances beyond the hotel's control render the fulfilment of the contract impossible; rooms or spaces are reserved with culpably misleading or false information or concealment regarding essential facts; the identity or solvency of the customer or the purpose of his stay can constitute essential facts; the hotel has justified cause to believe that use of the hotel's services might jeopardize the smooth operation of the hotel, its security or public reputation, without being attributable to the hotel's sphere of control or organization; the purpose or the cause of the stay is illegal; there is a breach of the above-mentioned No. 1.2. 5.4 The justified withdrawal by the hotel constitutes no claims for damages for the customer.</li>
                <li><span className="font-semibold text-[#bf840d]">Room Availability, Delivery and Return</span><br />6.1 The customer does not acquire the right to be provided specific rooms insofar as this is not expressly agreed. 6.2 Reserved rooms are available to the customer starting at 3:00 p.m. on the agreed arrival date. The customer does not have the right to earlier availability. 6.3 Rooms must be vacated and made available to the hotel no later than 12:00 noon on the agreed departure date. After that time, on the grounds of the delayed vacating of the room for use exceeding the contractual time, the hotel may charge 50 % of the full accommodation rate (list price) for the additional use of the room until 6:00 p.m. (after 6:00 p.m.: 90 %). Contractual claims of the customer shall not be established hereby. The customer is at liberty to prove that the hotel has no or a much lower claim for charges for use of the room. 6.4 Unmarried couples are not allowed 6.5 visitors are not allowed</li>
                <li><span className="font-semibold text-[#bf840d]">Liability of the Hotel</span><br />7.1 The hotel is not liable for harm inflicted on life, limb and physical health. Further, it is liable for other damage caused with full intent or gross negligence or due to intentional or grossly negligent violation of obligations typical for the contract. A breach of obligation of the hotel is deemed to be the equivalent to a breach of a statutory representative or vicarious agent. All other claims for damages are excluded, if not determined differently in this No. 7. Should disruptions or defects in the performance of the hotel occur, the hotel shall act to remedy such upon knowledge thereof or upon objection by the customer made without undue delay. The customer shall be obliged to undertake actions reasonable for him to eliminate the disruption and to keep any possible damage to a minimum. 7.2 The hotel is not liable to the customer for property brought into the hotel in accordance with the statutory provisions. It recommends the use of the hotel or room safe. If the guest wishes to bring with him money, securities, stocks, bonds or valuables with a value of more than 800 EUR or other things with a value of more than 3500 EUR, a separate safekeeping agreement is necessary. 7.3 Insofar as a parking space is provided to the customer in the hotel garage or a hotel parking lot, this does not constitute a safekeeping agreement, even if a fee is exchanged. 7.4 Wake-up calls are carried out by the hotel with the greatest possible diligence. Messages, mail, and merchandise deliveries for guests shall be handled with care. The hotel will deliver, hold, and, for a fee, forward such items (on request). The hotel only assumes liability according to preceding No. 7, sentences 1 to 4.</li>
              </ol>
              <h2 className="border-l-4 border-[#bf840d] pl-4 mb-6 text-2xl font-bold  py-2 rounded mt-10">GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR EVENTS:</h2>

                <li><span className="font-semibold text-[#bf840d]">Scope of Applicability</span><br />1.1 These terms and conditions shall apply to contracts for the rental of the hotel's conference, banquet, and convention rooms for events such as banquets, seminars, conferences, exhibitions and presentations, etc., as well as all other additional services and goods performed/provided in connection therewith by the hotel for the customer. 1.2 The hotel's prior consent in written form is required if the rooms, areas, or display cases are to be rented or sublet to a third party, or if invitations are issued for introductory interviews, sales promotions, or similar events. 1.3 The customer's general terms and conditions shall apply only if this is previously expressly agreed.</li>
                <li><span className="font-semibold text-[#bf840d]">Conclusion of Contract, Parties, Liability, Statute of Limitations</span><br />2.1 The hotel and the customer are the contracting parties.

Further, it is liable for other damage caused with full intent or gross negligence or due to an intentional or grossly negligent violation of obligations typical for the contract. A breach of the obligation of the hotel is deemed to be the equivalent to a breach of a statutory representative or vicarious agent. All other claims for damages are excluded, if not determined differently in this No. 9. Should disruptions or defects in the performance of the hotel occur, the hotel shall act to remedy such upon knowledge thereof or upon objection by the customer made without undue delay. The customer shall be obliged to undertake actions reasonable for him to eliminate the disruption and to keep any possible damage to a minimum. In addition, the customer shall be obliged to notify the hotel in due time if there is a possibility that extraordinarily extensive damage may be incurred. 2.3 Any claims against the hotel shall generally be time-barred one year after the commencement of the general statute of limitations period. Damage claims shall be time-barred after five years, independent of knowledge thereof, insofar as they are not based on claims arising out of harm inflicted on life, limb, physical health or liberty. These damage claims shall be time-barred after ten years independent of knowledge thereof. The reduction of the statute of limitation periods shall not apply to claims which are based on an intentional or grossly negligent breach of obligation by the hotel.</li>

In particular, this applies to claims of copyright collecting agencies. 3.3 The agreed prices include all taxes in effect at the time of the conclusion of the contract. If the statutory value-added tax is changed or if local taxes concerning the services are newly introduced, changed or abolished after these have been contractually agreed upon, the prices will be adjusted.
